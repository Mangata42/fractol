#6 Project

Fractol is a little program that displays three of the most famous abstract fractals.

<ul>
	<li> Compiling </li>
	<code>make</code>
	<li> Running </li>
	<code>./fractol [fractal_type] </code>
	Fractal types are : 
		<ul>
			</li> Mandelbrot </li>
			<li> Julia </li>
			<li> Burningship </li>
		</ul>
	<li> Cleaning </li>
	<code>fclean</code>
</ul>
With each type of fractals, you can increase the number of iterations with 'w' or decrease it with 's'. You can also switch to a different color set with 'a' and 'd'. <br>
You can also zoom in or out with your mouse scroll. 
<br>
For Julia, the starting point will move, following your mouse pointer. To pause the movements, press 'space'. Press it again to resume it.
